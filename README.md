What is etlUnit anyway?
=======

etlUnit was created because there is no testing framework that truly addresses ETL testing in a manner that fits into
modern coding practices (i.e. object oriented coding) that also interfaces with the various data integration tools.
This is not surprising due to the nature of data integration tools because many of them are proprietary and don't play
 well outside of their tool suites.  etlUnit is designed to use black/grey box testing practices as well as utilize the
 best practices of the xUnit family of testing tools.

Things to come with the project:
* ReadTheDocs page
* TravisCI integration
* Quickstart
* What non-Python deps do we have and how do you install them
